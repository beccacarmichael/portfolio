                <h2>About Me</h2> 
                <p>
                    I am a life long adventurer and nature lover. I have been able to combine my passion for nature, 
                    the environment and the outdoors in my past education, career and travels. I have been able to work 
                    along some great people and do some great things and I can not wait to continue leading my life to align with my passions.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I am a recent graduate of the Geographic Information Systems Post- Graduate program at Fleming College and am able to 
                    combine my past education in Environmental Geography at Nipissing University and Ecosystem Management at Fleming College 
                    to hone my understanding and skills. I have developed a passion for displaying data and information visually so viewers from
                    all walks of life are able to interact and understand the material.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    During my education I have also been able to study along like-minded people and learn from them to not only develop my education 
                    but also develop my passion for environmental protection and integrity. 
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    I enjoy many different types of adventuring from camping, hiking and mountain biking to traveling and exploring 
                    new areas. I have been able to travel both near and far and have gotten to experience many new cultures and natural areas. 
                    I have traveled form Ontario east and to many places in the US and Europe. After each trip I always come home with many 
                    new stories and a strengthened connection to the environment.
